## Project Overview
This data analysis project uses HR data to evaluate key aspects of a company's workforce. Through a comprehensive examination of employee demographics, distribution, tenure, and turnover rates, the objective is to gain insights that will support strategic HR decisions and foster an inclusive and efficient work environment.

## Data Source
The dataset utilized for this project consists of employee information recorded in a CSV file, with columns including `empl_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `birthdate`, `gender`, `race`, `department`, `jobtitle`, `location`, `hire_date`, `termdate`, `city`, and `state`.

## Tools
